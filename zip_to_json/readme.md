# python script converts geoname.org data to json

The data for United States has been included in this repository

This script has been tested with the US.txt file in US.zip but if you wish to try out data from other countries then download the zip file [here](https://download.geonames.org/export/zip/), and extract into this directory. You will then need to change the variable __input_filename__ in geoname_tsv_to_json.py to \<Country Code\>.txt, and change __output_filename__ to whatever you wish.
